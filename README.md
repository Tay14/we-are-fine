# WE ARE FINE


### Versioning:
Normally, the version number should be a tag but, to make it simple we'll have it inside parantheses at the front of every commit message e.g **(v0.1.2) fix border width.**
```
v0.0.0
 ^ ^ ^
 | | |
 | | +--- Minor bugs (fixing Js, change text color, changing width/height and etc)
 | +----- Minor features (adding a div, a navbar, animations and etc)
 +------- Major version (a complete and functional product ready for testing/UX)
```

### Commit & Push:
* Always push to **dev branch** only.
* Always Include **version number** inside commit message.
* Commit/Push every **Minor Features**, personal preference on **Minor Bugs** or a limit of 10 changes/fixes.

### Git Cheatsheet:
If you are unsure with any command, try them out on your own repo or fork this one.
